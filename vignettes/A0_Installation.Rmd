# Easy installation

## Linux

NOTE: See [distribution-specific instructions][Linux-distro] for
additional detail.

On debian-based systems, the easiest way to install _R_ is through a
package manager manager, run under an administrator account.  On Linux
one usually needs to install _R_ packages from source, and _R_ package
source often contains C, C++, or Fortran code requiring a compiler and
`-dev` versions of various system libraries. It is therefore
convenient to install the `-dev` version of R.

```
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```

When installing source packages, it may be necessary to have access to
the `-dev` version of various system libraries. Many of these are
installed as dependencies of `r-base-dev`; other common examples
include the xml and curl libraries

```
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl-dev
```

Note in particular the use specification of libraries (the `lib`
prefix) and the use of the `-dev` version.

To install _RStudio_, visit the [RStudio download][] page. Download
the appropriate archive for your OS. On Ubuntu, install the `.deb`
installer with

```
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-1.0.136-amd64.deb
```
