# Introduction to _R_

Date (Tentative): Monday and Tuesday, September 11 -12<br />
Instructors: Martin Morgan, Ezgi Karaesmen<br />
Affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute; Ohio State University<br />
Contact: Martin.Morgan at RoswellPark.org

This two-day workshop provides an introduction to R and Bioconductor for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. The workshop assumes no knowledge of R. We will move at a steady pace, and cover quite a bit of ground. The goals are to familiarize particpants with common ways in which data, including genomic data, are explored and analyzed in R, and to provide participants with tools necessary for their own continued self-education.
