This two-day workshop provides an introduction to _R_ and
_Bioconductor_ for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
genomic data. The workshop assumes only limited knowledge of _R_, but
moves quickly. The goals are to familiarize users with common ways in
which data, including genomic data, are explored and analyzed in _R_,
and to provide users with tools necessary for their own continued
self-education.

## Day 1: Introduction to _R_

1. Introduction -- _RStudio_ and _R_

2. Data Input and Manipulation

3. Statistical Analysis

4. Visualization

## Day 2: Introduction to _Bioconductor_

1. Working with _Bioconductor_

2. Exploring Genomic Data in _Bioconductor_

3. An RNASeq Workflow

4. Next Steps
