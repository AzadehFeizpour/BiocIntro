# Introduction to _R_ and _Bioconductor_

Date: Thursday and Friday, March 2-3<br />
Instructors: Martin Morgan, Lori Shepherd<br />
Affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute<br />
Contact: Martin.Morgan at RoswellPark.org

This two-day workshop provides an introduction to _R_ and
_Bioconductor_ for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
genomic data. The workshop assumes only limited knowledge of _R_, but
moves quickly. The goals are to familiarize users with common ways in
which data, including genomic data, are explored and analyzed in _R_,
and to provide users with tools necessary for their own continued
self-education.
