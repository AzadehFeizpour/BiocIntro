# Introduction to _R_ and _Bioconductor_

This is a two day computer training course. The course involves
introductory _R_ and _Bioconductor_ material and specific
_Bioconductor_ RNA-seq and ChIP-seq work flows. Instruction involves
lecture presentations and supervised activities, approximately 9am –
5pm with two short breaks (15 – 30 minutes) and 1 lunch break each
day. All training resources will be made available on-line prior to,
during, and after the course. All participants must have access to a
computer with modern web browser.

The following is an approximate schedule.

## Day 1: Introduction to R

9:00 - 10:30. [Introduction][] -- RStudio and R.

11:00 - 12:30. [Data Input and Manipulation][].

1:30 - 3:00. [Statistical Analysis][].

3:30 - 5:00. [R Workflows and Visualization][].

## Day 2: Introduction to Bioconductor

9:00 - 10:30. [Bioconductor introduction][] and [Common operations][].

11:00 - 11:30. Continued

11:30 - 12:30. [RNASeq][] -- introduction and pactical.

1:30 - 2:30. RNASeq, continued.

3:00 - 5:00. Approaches to ChIP-seq.
