# UP-STAT 2017 Workshop: Exploring Data in _R_

Date: Friday, April 21<br />
Instructors: Martin Morgan<br />
Affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute<br />
Contact: Martin.Morgan at RoswellPark.org

This workshop provides some ideas for 'looking at' data during
statistical analysis.  During the workshop, we will look at a moderate
sized RNA-seq gene expression data set, discovering basic problems
with the data and exploring possible solutions. The skills explored
are relevant in many other areas of statistical data analysis.

The workshop is designed for those with some familiarity with the _R_
programming langauge for statistical analysis, and with the _RStudio_
environment.

For the workshop, please come with a laptop with wireless access and a
recent version of Chrome or Firefox web browser.
