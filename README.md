# Introduction to _R_ and _Bioconductor_

Date: Thursday and Friday, March 2-3<br />
Instructors: Martin Morgan, Lori Shepherd<br />
Affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute<br />
Contact: Martin.Morgan at RoswellPark.org

This two-day workshop provides an introduction to _R_ and
_Bioconductor_ for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
genomic data. The workshop assumes no knowledge of _R_. We will move
at a steady pace, and cover quite a bit of ground. The goals are to
familiarize particpants with common ways in which data, including
genomic data, are explored and analyzed in _R_, and to provide participants
with tools necessary for their own continued self-education.
