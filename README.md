# Introduction to _R_ and _Bioconductor_

This is a two day computer training course. Introductory R and
Bioconductor material (day 1) and specific Bioconductor RNA-seq and
ChIP-seq work flows (day 2). Instruction involves lecture
presentations and supervised activities, approximately 9am – 5pm with
two short breaks (15 – 30 minutes) and 1 lunch break each day. All
training resources will be made available on-line prior to, during,
and after the course. All participants must have access to a computer
