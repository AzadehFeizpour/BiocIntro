# _R_ and _Bioconductor_ for Genomic Analysis

Date: Monday and Tuesday, September 11 - 12<br />
Instructors: Martin Morgan, Ezgi Karaesmen, Abbas Rizvi<br />
Affiliation: Roswell Park Cancer Institute; Ohio State University<br />
Contact: Martin.Morgan at RoswellPark.org

This two-day workshop provides an introduction to _R_ and _Bioconductor_ for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. The workshop assumes modest knowledge of _R_. We will move at a steady pace, and cover quite a bit of ground. The goals are to familiarize particpants with common ways in which data, including genomic data, are explored and analyzed in _R_, and to provide participants with tools necessary for their own continued self-education.

Day 1

- Basics of _R_ -- vectors, data.frames, linear models
- Tidy data
- _Bioconductor_ data representations -- _GenomicRanges_, _SummarizedExperiment_, and friends
- Organizing work -- scripts, markdown, packages

Day 2

- Exploring RNA-seq data
- Differential expression analysis with DESeq2
- Results in context -- annotation, gene set enrichment, etc.
- Writing better _R_ code
