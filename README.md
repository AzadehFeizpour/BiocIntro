# _R_ for High-Throughput (Genomic) Analysis

The _R_ statistical programming language is used extensively across a broad spectrum of informatic domains; my area of expertise (see https://bioconductor.org) is the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. This workshop takes a quickly-paced, high-level tour of _R_ in data analysis. We'll start with the very basics, but move on to data representation, transformation and visualization. The workshop will be interesting to new and experienced _R_ practitioner, as well as to data scientists exploring the diversity of approaches to modern interactive analysis. We'll have hands-on activities that are both challenging and rewarding.

Additional material will be available here shortly before the session.
